# Chess

This is my main project, currently, where I use knowledge gained while working on snake to build chess from scratch. The main goal with this project is to check if I'm able to build it without internet or any other sources. I'm currently working on checking mechanic and the game is almost done. Main goal for now is to make it fully functional and then optimize it still without useing any third party help, and at the end see what my mistakes are and fix them. Below I post some things that I'm not satisfied with and need some work to be more optimal:

  1. I think that Kings class and its way to check if castle is possible is too complicated.

  2. Loading png into jLabel should be done in Figure class instead of classes that extends it but I have to do it before super() or program wouldn’t work    so I just don’t know how to do that.

  3. I think that checking every figures move every time that one figure moves is not efficient and I should do something about it
